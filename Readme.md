Instructions to Crack Bootstrap Studio 5.1.1

To crack for Windows or macOS then skip to step 4 after the installtion.

1. Extract the zip file into a new folder
2. Now extract the Bootstrap-Studio-5.1.1-x64.AppImage using this command
```bash
$ ./Bootstrap-Studio-5.1.1-x64.AppImage --appimage-extract
```
3. A new folder named *squashfs-root* is created
4. Delete the original app.asar inside *squashfs-root*/resources/
5. Copy the app.asar inside 'Crack' folder to *squashfs-root*/resources/
6. To run the bstudio execute inside squashfs-root
```bash
$ ./AppRun
```
OR
```bash
$ ./bstudio
```
7. You can also change the name of squashfs-root to desired name [ex. bstudio]



PS :- This crack is nor developed by me, neither I am connected to this crack in anyway. This crack was intended for the windows/macos version and I just did a little extraction, copy and paste to make it work for the linux version because this version was not available for linux.
